# Evolution-of-drug-use-in-Europe-since-2010

The evolution of drug use in Europe (Alcohol, Tobacco, Cannabis, Amphetamine, Cocaine, Ecstasy, Opiates) is studied from 2010 to the present and how different factors affect:
- Different drugs (Alcohol, Tobacco, Cannabis, Amphetamine, Cocaine, Ecstasy, Opiates (Codeine, heroin, morphine))
- Poor/rich countries (higher per capita income, higher educational attainment) - Economic inequality index (Gini): 
- Crime rate
- Age comparison
- Higher legalization policies 
- Urbanization rate
- Drug prices
- Legalization policies

The different hypotheses that have been put forward are as follows:
- hypothesis_1 = “ Consumption has been reversed by political and educational measures, especially with regard to tobacco”.
- hypothesis_2 = “There is less use of so-called hard drugs (and if so, whether there is a greater use of soft drugs, on the other hand)”.
- hypothesis 3 = “Poor countries still tend to consume more drugs than countries with a higher ‘quality of life’ (higher per capita income, higher educational attainment)”.
- hypothesis_4 = “Alcohol consumption remains constant”.
- hypothesis_5 = “Overall, there is a trend towards a reduction in alcohol consumption, thanks to the measures imposed”.
- hypothesis_6 = “There is a significant difference in the type of drugs consumed in relation to age”.
- hypothesis_7 = “Digitalization has had a positive influence”.
- Hypothesis_8 = “There is a decrease in the COVID era”.
- Hypothesis_8 = “Countries where certain drugs have been legalized are consuming more (Holland, Portugal, Malta, Czech Republic,...)”.
