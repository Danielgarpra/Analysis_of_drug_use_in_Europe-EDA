# <center>**Evolution of drug use in Europe EDA**</center>

During the late twentieth century and the early twenty-first century, there has been increased awareness of drug use worldwide. This has led to various measures aimed at controlling the situation, including prevention strategies through educational campaigns, improved access to treatment and rehabilitation, stronger drug trafficking controls, and enhanced research and monitoring.

The question is: Have these measures been effective? To explore that, this EDA examines trends in drug use across different countries, specifically focusing on the twenty-first century in the European Union. The analysis also includes the participation of Norway and Turkey, based on surveys conducted by the European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA) on the prevalence and patterns of drug use in the general population with an age range of 15-64 (*https://www.euda.europa.eu/data/statistical-bulletin/archive_en*). The type of drugs surveyed were alcohol, tobacco, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and LSD. In addition, we will use the Eurostat source to obtain the Gini coefficient of the countries (*https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tessi190/default/table?lang=en*). All this data can be found in [this link](EDA/Own_projet)

The following aspects will be analyzed in this EDA:

- Analysis of consumption trends across the selected countries
- Assessment of consumption by gender
- Maximum consumption values by country
- If there is an increase in the countries where it is legalized
- Evaluation of consumption by countries based on the Gini coefficient
